The game of Dr Nim is played between two people. 
To play the game you need a line of coins. 
This can be any amount, however it is typical to choose 12 coins to play.

Each player takes turns choosing to remove 1, 2, or 3 coins from the line. 
The goal of the game is to take the last coins from the line.

The player that goes second is always able to win the game if they follow a strategy. 
The strategy is to make the amount of coins a multiple of 4 at all times.
Let's simulate a game...

OOOOOOOOOOOO - 12
Player 1 takes 3 coins

OOOOOOO - 9
The next multiple of 4 is 8 in this case so...
Player 2 takes 1 coin.

OOOOOOOO - 8
Player 1 takes 1 coin

OOOOOOO - 7
Again, the next multiple of 4...
Player 2 takes 3 coins

OOOO - 4
And we have Player 1 in a corner. 
If they take 1 coins, there will be 3 left and we win. If they take 2 coins then we will take 2, and if they take 3 we take 1.
They have no move which does not lose the game.

Looking back, we have Player 1 in this situation multiple times. 
It's the same thing when Player 1 has to take from 8 coins, because we are always able to force them to take from 4, allowing us to win.
Also, it's the same at the very beginning of the game. Player 1 has to choose from 12 coins, but we can always force them to take from 8 next turn.

That's how it's possible to win every time. 
This strategy is very simple to code, but this program doesn't inherently know how to win every time.
